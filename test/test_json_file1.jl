Automobilwoche has claimed that Porsche is developing passenger drones , and is close to showing off its first design sketch.  While there's clearly not much to show at this point, you would have some control over the machine but wouldn't need a pilot's license -- like other in-progress drones, a large chunk of the flight control would be automated. While it's not clear that Porsche is ready to confirm the details, it's clearly open to the idea.  Company sales lead Detlev von Platen noted that it takes him \"at least half an hour\" just to drive from Porsche's plant in Zuffenhausen to the airport in Stuttgart, but just \"three and a half minutes\" with an aircraft. It may seem odd for Porsche to not only venture into flying vehicles, but hands-off vehicles.  Isn't that anathema to enthusiasts used to taking the wheel?  However, it's likely feeling pressure to do something in the passenger drone space.  Its rival Daimler is backing Volocopter's drone , while Volvo parent Geely recently bought Terrafugia .  Even Porsche owner Volkswagen has dipped its toes into the waters: its Italdesign wing partnered with Airbus on the Pop.Up flying car concept .  If Porsche doesn't explore passenger drones, there's a possibility that it could miss out as the transportation world shifts away from human-piloted cars and toward autonomous vehicles of all kinds.", "source_categories": ["tech"]}

Large organizations can also use it to search their domain names as a group and now, the service counts the UK and Australian governments among them. As Hunt explained in a blog post : \"Amongst those verified domain searches are government departments and they too are enormously varied; local councils, legal and health services, telecoms and infrastructure etc...The thing is, loads of government departments within different countries have all been running these searches independently and that means an awful lot of duplication of effort has been going on.\" So, to make things more efficient, he's set up the service to allow the UK's National Cyber Security Centre and the Australian Cyber Security Centre to be able to search for any .gov.uk or .gov.au domain, respectively. This way, the governments can search all government-associated domains all at one time rather than each individual department having to do it separately themselves. Regarding why he's providing the service for free, Hunt said \"We really want governments to do their best to protect the folks working in their departments; many of them are working in capacities that help protect our respective nations from all sorts of threats and increasingly, as we all know, that means online threats as well.\" Hunt's tools are incredibly popular. Recently, Hunt's leaked password search service Pwned Passwords was incorporated into 1Password , making it easy for 1Password subscribers to check if their passwords have been exposed in any number of data breaches. Others who have implemented the new version of Pwned Passwords include Cloudflare , Nextcloud , Azure Functions and Iowa State University .", "source_categories": ["tech"]}

While it's a bit harder to see Red Sparrow, MoviePass is pushing Death Wish, which also opened this week. The other issue is the reports it has been requiring some users to send in pictures of their ticket stub before using their card again, ostensibly to prevent abuse. In a statement to Gizmodo , MoviePass said \"There are multiple methods by which individuals can abuse our service, so we are developing and testing a few different catch-all systems that will help prevent against fraud...The group we are testing this feature on has not done anything wrong, but they will help us to determine if this new system is effective.\"", "source_categories": ["tech"]}

According to Business Insider , Amazon's retail team told Nest on a call that the e-commerce website won't be listing the Google-owned company's newer products. Those include Nest's new thermostats and its Secure home security system launched late last year. While the team didn't say who exactly issued the order, it reportedly told Nest's employees that the decision \"came from the top.\" Whether that means Amazon chief Jeff Bezos was behind the move is unclear -- either way, Nest is apparently responding in kind by leaving the website altogether. BI said that once Nest's current inventory on Amazon is sold out, it'll no longer replenish its stocks. Nest wants to be able to offer its whole portfolio on the platform. It would rather not sell anything on the website at all if it can't, though it's still unclear if that means even third-party sellers can't list Nest devices on the marketplace. An Amazon rep told Engadget that the company doesn't have an official response to the report, but she didn't deny it either. It's worth noting that Amazon recently purchased Ring's smart doorbell business: The company is expected to integrate Ring's products into its ecosystem and to find more possible Alexa tie-ins. Amazon has been growing its smart home biz in other ways for quite a while, though. In addition to making its own devices like the Cloud Cam , it also acquired home security company Blink, which makes smart doorbells and wireless security cameras, in December. The e-commerce titan first waged war against Google back in 2015 when it pulled Chromecast (and Apple TV) listings over the lack of Prime Video support. Google then blocked the Echo Show and Fire TV devices from accessing YouTube due to \"lack of reciprocity.\" The relationship between the clashing corporations seemed to be on the mend back in December when Amazon announced that it'll start selling Chromecasts (and Apple TVs) again.

An automotive news outlet from the Netherlands called AutoRAI spoke with Mazda's European vice president for sales and customer service. He told the outlet that Mazda has an electric car coming In 2019, and it will be available with a rotary engine as a generator. Among the details about this car and its powertrain, he said it would be similar in size to the Mazda3 , and it might even be a crossover . It will also be based on Mazda's upcoming modular small car platform. The rotary engine will only generate electricity and will only have one rotor. Not only that, it will be mounted horizontally. This is particularly unusual as every rotary Mazda has had the engine mounted upright. We've reached out to Mazda representatives in the U.S. and Europe. An American representative couldn't comment on what type of range-extender options may be coming in the future. We say this specifically because Mazda has confirmed previously that an EV with an available range extender is coming in 2019. We have not heard back from a European representative at the time of publishing. Despite this, a return of the rotary as a range extender looks probable. Besides the dates fitting with Mazda's electric plans, there are other tidbits from the past that support the idea. Mazda has been experimenting with the idea for years, and even created a functioning Mazda2 EV with a rotary range-extender. The company has also filed patents in the U.S. for the setup as recently as last year, and there have been other recent rumors . Related Video:", "source_categories": ["tech"]}

These kinds of clones have been a part of the industry forever, clogging up eBay and disappointing whoever buys them. The S9 is indeed the latest in a long line of clones, but as I discovered, the forces that brought it to market are more interesting than the facsimile itself. After all, it seems odd that a company with the resources to build a portfolio of products and lock down a sponsorship deal with Tottenham Hotspur FC would resort to blatant copying. And these copies aren't much to write home about either. The S9s at Leagoo's booth ran a very buggy version of Android, and the hardware felt chintzy and insubstantial. Those software issues should get worked out before launch, but honestly, this is exactly the kind of cut-rate experience you'd expect from a $150 iPhone clone. That said, the bits of the iPhone X Leagoo attempted to copy at least look correct. The notch is roughly the right size, and the 13+2MP dual camera around back looks more or less spot-on, even if it doesn't take particularly great pictures. The Leagoo S9 I played with seemed far from finished, but even at its best, it seems unlikely to thrill. And the iPhone isn't the only flagship Leagoo has attempted to ape, either. Off to the side of Leagoo's booth at MWC was a plasticky phone with a dual camera and stripes etched horizontally high on its back. That was the company aiming at a domestic rival: Huawei's high-powered Mate 10 Pro . In fairness, Leagoo designs and produces original smartphones as well -- quite a few, in fact. After a conversation with Leagoo Senior Vice President Zhijie Xie, things became more clear. For Leagoo, cranking out the occasional clone phone isn't just a way for the company to capitalize on new trends in the industry. It's about survival. \"For right now, the situation for the mobile phone business,\" Xie said, his voice trailing off a little. \"Especially [when you're] like us -- you just have to stay alive.\" The S9 then is pure marketing given physical form, a device meant to drive buzz in hopes of boosting the business as a whole. If this sounds familiar, well, it should: that's the idea being the new Nokia's string of retro phone releases. \"This one just makes some noise,\" conceded Xie while gesturing to the S9. The weariness in his voice was apparent, and he's earned it. Leagoo is still a small company, with only a few hundred employees and two factories: one in Shenzhen and one in Sichuan province. And given the sort of global competition small companies like Leagoo face, carving out a space in the market is no easy feat. On a large scale, Apple and Samsung tend to dominate both smartphone conversations and market share to the point where even highly capable competitors are struggling to make an impact. \"Even for LG and Sony sales are going down every year,\" Xie said. \"We just [have to] stay alive and try to find some core-selling products.\" Leagoo's search for those core products has been a tricky one so far. Xie pointed out that the company's M-series smartphones were doing well, but a recent release fizzled out because of performance issues related to its Spreadtrum chipset. These kinds of issues seem even more painful when you consider Leagoo's limited reach. Despite its firmly Chinese origins, Leagoo doesn't sell phones there at all. All of the companies efforts are concentrated in southeast Asia and eastern Europe, partially because standing up to China's internal competition can be nearly impossible for upstarts. \"We never did China,\" Xie added. \"The competition is too strong. Huawei, Xiaomi, Meizu, they're all there.\" And beyond just being there, those companies have much more experience cutting deals with Chinese carriers and retailers, leading to a situation where smaller can be boxed out of their own home. \"At the beginning, we created this company and decided to only focus on overseas markets,\" said Xie. \"In China, you sometimes need relationships; we do not have the background, and so we chose fair markets. If you work hard, if your products are good, you can sell.\" I'll admit to being surprised after playing with a few other Leagoo smartphones at the booth. They were perfectly passable devices. The low price tags involved meant they couldn't stack up to many of the devices I regularly test, but the phones themselves seem sound. When it isn't churning out clones, Leagoo seems to do decent work. Whether that's enough to help Leagoo find its place in the world is a different story.

Parts resembling leaves, bushes and trees will be made from a polyethylene created with ethanol made from sugarcane. And while these only make up between 1 and 2 percent of all the pieces Lego makes, it's \"a great first step in our ambitious commitment of making all Lego bricks using sustainable materials,\" Lego VP of environmental responsibility Tim Brooks said on its website. These 'green' pieces will be released in sets starting this year. It's part of the company's pledge to transition to using sustainable materials in Lego products and packaging by 2030. Creating plastic parts from sugarcane -- called 'bioplastics' -- isn't a perfect solution, as that crop still requires a lot of farmland, and growing more could cut into land allocated for food production. Further, the historical demand for sugarcane has degraded tropical forests and coastal wetlands; More demand could lead to further deforestation. Changing the Lego recipe from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (based on crude oil) to a plant-sourced plastic is certainly a more sustainable choice. And though sugarcane isn't a perfect source for bioplastics, it's a first step toward making your favorite building toys (and future domestic caltrops) a little greener.", "source_categories": ["tech"]}

AgeID will ask porn site visitors to create an encrypted login that verifies their age across any compatible site, saving them from having to prove they're 18 or older every time they want to view some racy material. The system will draw on third-party age verification companies, but Mindgeek promises that AgeID won't store any personal info -- it'll only keep \"standard technical data\" to prevent fraud as well as that protected login. The technology will be available to every porn site available inside the UK. It'll be free for independent UK porn studios, producers and bloggers, and will cost a flat fee for others depending on their volume of British traffic. It should be available when the Digital Economy Act, the law mandating age checks in the UK, takes effect in April. This isn't the very first implementation of AgeID.  It's been in use in Germany since 2015.  However, there are questions about the control it would hand over to Mindgeek and its brands (which include RedTube, YouPorn and Brazzers, among others).  If there isn't a major viable alternative, one porn distributor may effectively determine how everyone else checks ages.  And it's not clear what constitutes an \"independent\" studio.  Is there a fixed metric, or will Mindgeek use subjective criteria?  While there's no immediate indication that it intends to abuse its first-mover advantage (it could have charged everyone), there's a lingering concern that it may have the power to decide which porn sites succeed -- and that the government may have trusted too much of its regulatory power to a private firm.", "source_categories": ["tech"]}

Samsung was here in full-force, Sony outed a pair of surprisingly compelling flagship phones, Vivo showed up with yet another kooky concept -- the list goes on. As always, though, Team Engadget happened upon some other developments that captivated us more than we expected. That's MWC for you -- it'll always catch you by surprise. As we board our planes and begin our long treks home, join us for a final look at some of our favorite things -- not just gadgets -- from MWC. (Oh, and take a gander at our unnerving AR emoji while you're at it.) Nokia x Kolon First Responders jacket I don't have to think about this once twice. My favorite thing from MWC 2018, by far, was Nokia's smart jacket for first responders . Not only does it have the potential to help cops or firefighters during emergencies with features like a removable heart rate monitor and body camera -- it looks like it came straight out of a menswear runway show, too. Its fashionable streetwear looks are no accident either, since Nokia worked with Kolon (a South Korean fashion brand) to design the jacket. I'll probably never own it, but at least I got to try it on for a few minutes here in Barcelona. Galaxy S9/S9+ AR emojis Of all the new features of the Galaxy S9 and S9+ , the most interesting is AR Emoji. Sure, it's easy to dismiss this feature as an imitation of Apple's Animoji, and the emoji themselves creep some people out. But the fact that they were controversial and invite participation makes this arguably the standout addition to the Galaxy S series. Technologically, the feature isn't the most impressive -- its depiction of faces varies wildly in accuracy, there are limited styles to choose from when customizing your avatar and the front camera struggles to pick up your facial movements and reproduce them. Still, almost everyone on my team here made their own AR Emoji and some of them even clamored to try it out. We had a ball of a time doing impressions of each other, using the person's avatar. Yes, the novelty of AR Emojis will eventually wear out, but for now it provided a hell of a lot of fun, and certainly cheered me up this cold, bleak MWC. The exaggerated death of the headphone jack Any company that makes wireless headphones and buds might try to convince you that the future is set: get rid of those silly (cheaper, universal) headphones, and get some Bluetooth things instead. However, MWC 2018's graduating class of smartphones had only three devices that nixed the 3.5mm socket: Sony's duo of Xperia XZ2 phones and Nokia's new flagship redesign, the Sirocco 8 . Options are good. Holding onto my reliable, wired, no-recharge needed earbuds is even better. Huawei MateBook X Pro I'm still searching for my dream Windows laptop. I like the Dell XPS 13, but the design is dull and the bezel between the hinge and the display is a little large for my tastes. I like the Surface Laptop too, but it's expensive and the alcantara material worries me. That's why I'm so intrigued by the Huawei MateBook X Pro that was announced at Mobile World Congress. It has a simple, Macbook-esque look and the screen-to-body ratio is phenomenal. The pop-up webcam? It's a nice idea, but I think the up-the-nose viewing angle is awful. Thankfully, I rarely take video calls. Otherwise, the MateBook X Pro seems like a solid ultrabook with plenty of power and an adequate selection of ports. Everything I want, basically, from a Macbook Pro replacement. The first wave of Android Go Edition phones Android Go was first announced at last year's Google I/O developer conference, but the first Go Edition phones just showed up here in Spain. In terms of hardware, none of them are particularly special, save for maybe the cutesy, familiar Nokia 1. Even so, I find Google's commitment to building a more consistent kind of Android experience for people, no matter how much they paid for their smartphone, terribly admirable. Google's suite of Go-enabled apps are a pleasure to use too, and I'm pleased that vital features like Google Assistant are now available to just about everyone. It'll take some time to really understand Android Go's impact, but since Google has confirmed it will make Go builds for future Android versions, I think we just might be entering the golden age of cheap phones.

Now, you'd think that in a time when YouTube is plastered with extremist videos and Instagram gives murderers room to express themselves , some legislation would come along to encourage website owners to tackle those problems. But you'd be wrong. Instead, conservative groups have rushed in to force changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act . Currently, 230 shields online intermediaries from liability for user-generated speech. Yet it also allows for prosecution of those intermediaries under federal criminal law (such as federal anti-trafficking statutes that are already in place). The proposed changes to Section 230 are specifically designed to sweep nasty, awful sex people off the internet -- along with the very sex trafficking victims they claim to be helping. According to critics, FOSTA-SESTA (two bills Frankenstein-stitched together) is the worst thing to happen to the internet since the death of net neutrality. If this passes, \"Risk-averse platforms will likely block too much content to avoid criminal liability and civil claims,\" the Center for Democracy & Technology explains . This will inhibit everyone's ability to speak freely and to access information. If platforms are compelled to use content filters to screen out potentially trafficking-related material, this effect will be amplified because automated filtering is notoriously overbroad. Small platforms, such as specialized message boards and online communities that serve niche interests, will find it particularly difficult to survive under [FOSTA-SESTA]'s increased liability risk. [FOSTA-SESTA] would have the unintended consequence of reducing diversity of viewpoints and forums for speech online. FOSTA-SESTA's opponents include the National Organization for Women, the ACLU, EFF, the Center for Democracy & Technology, national sex work right orgs , sex workers of all stripes , AIDS United, sex trafficking victims' rights groups, a variety of tech groups , and more -- including the Department of Justice. In the trenches of sex trafficking, and its unwilling cellmate, sex work, there's no doubt this is going to make everything much worse. Those who spoke with In Justice Today said that \"the legislation stands to do more harm than good by failing to distinguish between trafficking victims and sex workers, eliminating sex workers' source of income, and hampering anti-trafficking investigations.\" \"Allowing Internet platforms on which sexual services are brokered to thrive may be key to apprehending traffickers and recovering victims,\" wrote legal scholar Ariel Levy in a 2017 paper on sex commerce online . The paper concludes recommending against censoring and shuttering sex commerce spaces, finding that laws and algorithms which do so only push the activity underground, where it's difficult for law enforcement to monitor. The Department of Justice agrees. The DoJ sent a last-minute letter to lawmakers early this week saying FOSTA-SESTA is probably unconstitutional and will make finding and prosecuting sex traffickers more difficult . Doing something that so plainly drives the problem they're trying to solve underground -- further out of reach -- is a logic so convoluted it's nauseating. The House passed it anyway. That's because its backers and proponents are waging an effective disinformation campaign. They're saying it will help sex trafficking victims when it plainly won't. They have literally combined sex work and sex trafficking under a single, catch-all umbrella. And that includes all the at-risk populations represented by sex workers across the divides of race, gender , orientation, and social class. At the heart of this kind of thinking, of course, is sexist, classist belief that \"prostitution is bad\" (even though it's not universally illegal in the US). And an underlying fundamental belief that women are unable to make their own decisions about their bodies and their sexualities. Mind you, all genders and orientations do sex work, but you don't have to squint to see that this boils down to telling women what they can and can't do with their bodies. Again. The bill's proponents are using scare tactics, like pushing histrionic child rape anecdotes such as \"It's a sad and tragic fact: ordering a child for sex online can be as easy as ordering a pizza.\" Its pushers are also harnessing the influence of Trump's daughter , conservative politicians, gullible celebrities , and a few greedy internet corporations. FOSTA-SESTA has been hastened along by a government that is in such a hurry to combine church and state -- their church, their state. Its proponents include Ted Cruz, John McCain, Marco Rubio, Ivanka Trump, the Faith & Freedom Coalition , the aforementioned Morality in Media/NCSE , and politically conservative anti-sex work groups . Puzzlingly, it's also supported by the Internet Association -- a consortium that represents the largest (but not the smaller) internet companies. Open web pundits believe that the Internet Association's backing of FOSTA-SESTA is both a tactical error, and an example of the organization caving to the interests of that big internet money . Namely, companies like Facebook and Google who stand to gain from what the legislation will do to financially cripple smaller companies . Also, it's a lot easier to foster propaganda bubbles, strip privacy, and sell users to advertisers when you systematically remove art, culture, worldviews about gender, human sexuality, sexual health, and bodily autonomy under the rubric of anti-sex algorithms \"keeping communities safe.\" Since the advent of the popular internet, corporations and lawmakers have tried to shove all manner of disastrous laws down our throats by hiding their true motives behind \"child pornography\" or \"sex trafficking.\" Case in point: the \"great firewall of Britain\" which is the worst in-the-name-of-porn internet censorship enacted on a free population in the Western world . On top of the filters, their anti-porn laws plan to hand identity management to a corporate porn site with no accountability . Like over here, it's all in the name of protecting the children (and treating consenting adults like children, too). I guarantee you that if any UK decision makers -- lawmakers -- had asked sex workers and performers what they need, and talked to kids and parents about navigating the open web, things would be different. The solution would not have been overbroad and illegal blanket censorship , making an exploitative corporation into porn's gatekeeper , and what will surely be a spectacular privacy and security flamout. I mean, it's three weeks before the UK's porn ID system goes into effect, and still no one knows how it's happening . But they didn't ask anyone -- except anti-porn people who still insist that sex work is sex trafficking. A successful, decade-plus anti-porn movement, spearheaded by anti-porn feminists , backed up by sexist, out of step anti-porn press outlets brought the UK to this damning impasse of wrongheaded solutions. Their desires have always been clear: Censor things they simply don't like. Once again, it's sex workers are who are the most abused, ignored, and left behind by the failed promises of the open internet.", "source_categories": ["tech"]}

He has been testing an unreleased, prototype 70-inch 8K TV, and comparing it against a Sharp 4K model using 8K aerial footage he shot in LA. From seven feet away, \"which is within the ideal viewing distance for a 70-inch screen based on THX's numbers,\" the difference is like \"looking at a decent fine art print versus a really good one,\" he said. The footage is below, but you won't be able to appreciate it in 8K unless you have a very fast computer (faster than mine) and a screen with 8K resolution . (WIth LG's 5K monitor sold by Apple, you could at least appreciate the superiority of 8K over 4K, though.) RED hasn't confirmed the exact nature of the project with Sharp, or whether they're actually working on a consumer 8K TV together. However, it makes a lot of sense for RED to be boosting 8K tech, as it sells the 8K Weapon camera with both Super 35 and Vista Vision sensors. It also plans to release cheaper 8K cameras in partnership with Foxconn, according to a rumor from Nikkei . It's pretty darn hard for filmmakers and post-production facilities to find, let alone buy, 8K televisions or monitors. Companies like Panasonic, Sony and LG have all flaunted 8K TVs, but none are coming to the US anytime soon. Sharp itself is now selling 70-inch 8K TVs in Asia, and will soon bring them to Europe, but has no plans to release them in the US anytime soon, as far as we know. Holland told Engadget that the 8K prototype TV requires four HDMI cables, and that you need really good quality 8K footage to appreciate it. He notes that the 8K set can upscale 4K footage, but the difference between that and true 8K is \"pretty clear.\" He took closeup shots of both the 4K and 8K screens, with the latter appearing to have superior sharpness. The TV, he adds, is a \"special project between RED and Sharp.\" There's not even much 4K content yet, and most consumers still haven't switched from HD, so 8K is far from going mainstream. You'll likely see it in theaters well before it arrives to TVs, much like what happened with 4K. However, 8K is going to get a lot more attention in 2020 in Tokyo, because host broadcaster NHK plans to use the Olympics to showcase the new standard.", "source_categories": ["tech"]}

From today, Austinites who want to get their side hustle on will have access to one of 20 Chevrolet Bolt EVs , which they can use to provide rideshares or package and food deliveries, as a freelancer in the ever-growing gig economy. Prices start at $229 per week plus taxes, which as we've looked at before , doesn't leave a huge amount of scope for earnings after the initial outlay, but the service does provide a convenient way for those without a car (or one that's not good enough for ridesharing platforms like Uber) to make a bit of extra cash. Plus the price includes maintenance, commercial-use insurance and unlimited miles, which are big stingers for gig drivers that use their own vehicles. Maven is rolling out its first all-EV scheme with the support of Austin's \"Plug-in EVerywhere\" network of chargers, and says it will provide free charging for its customers for a limited time, although it's not clear when the cut-off point will be. The Chevy Bolt has a range of around 238 miles, which could prove restrictive, but the program has already seen reasonable success in other cities, including San Diego, San Francisco and Los Angeles. In fact, since the company's launch in November 2016 it's rolled its service out to nine cities in the US, so GM is certainly working the gig economy to its advantage.", "source_categories": ["tech"]}

The HAL (that's Hybrid Assistive Limb, not the murderous space AI) from medical device manufacturer, Cyberdyne Inc., has already been leveraged for a number of rehabilitative procedures since being released in Japan in 2011. Cyberdyne announced on Friday that it has teamed with the newly opened Brooks Cybernic Treatment Center of Jacksonville, Florida to make HALs available here in the US. The HAL is designed to fit around a spinal injury patient's legs and abdomen, providing support for people who would otherwise be unable to stand or walk. But unlike other exo-suits, patients command the HAL with their minds. Instead of a joystick or other manual controller, the HAL uses an EEG-like sensor to pick up nerve signals from the patient's brain through their skin which it then translates into a command to engage the suit's legs. What's more, this method trains the user to activate specific neural pathways for voluntary movement, which helps them improve their ability to walk unassisted. You will need at least some degree of sensation, however, for the treatment to work, Dr. Geneva Tonuzi, Medical Director of the Brooks Cybernic Treatment Center, told Engadget. \"It doesn't have to be much, but there has to be at least that signal. If you do have enough [bioelectric signal] going through to where the surface EMGs that are put on the legs can pick up the signal, then the robot can basically do the rest.\" \"So what's really nice about [HAL], it basically operates off what your intentions is,\" she continued. \"Maybe you're only able to give one or two percent, and then the robot gives the remainder of the motion. But, with time, because of that sort of recovery, you're about to get three percent, four percent, and so on, and the robot gives you less and less of that support.\" \"The goal is actually to get rid of the robot,\" Tonuzi concluded. \"This is your intervention, and after a certain period of time, you just move on back to regular therapy.\"", "source_categories": ["tech"]}

Ever since the 11-inch model disappeared in 2016, you've been looking at $999 or more for Apple's 'starter' laptop -- a tough sell given the aging design.  It might become a better value before long, however.  KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (who has a mostly solid track record for Apple leaks and rumors) has claimed that Apple is preparing a MacBook Air with a \"lower price tag\" for release this spring. Details are scarce at the moment, but 9to5Mac noted that this corroborated a sketchy claim from Digitimes . This doesn't mean that Apple will redesign the MacBook Air.  It gave the system just a modest spec bump in June 2017, and then only by using an older processor.  It may have reasons to make a more substantial update this year, however.  It might not have much choice but to upgrade to a modern processor thanks to Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities .  There's also the question of ports.  While plenty of people still rely on USB-A peripherals, it's hard to see Apple keeping the connector on laptops for much longer when the MacBook Pro and 12-inch MacBook both rely exclusively on USB-C.  The big question is whether or not Apple can move past the Air's old 1,440 x 900 display, which isn't very competitive when many newer laptops have 1080p displays with richer colors. Whatever happens to the hardware, a lower price would represent an acknowledgment that the MacBook Air is too important to cut from the lineup.  Many had suspected that the 12-inch MacBook would eventually take its place, but the newer machine's high price, lone port and limited performance have kept it from usurping the Air's throne.  Apple still has to lean on the Air whether or not it wants to move on, and that means making the system attractive enough to reel in buyers who would balk at the prices for other Mac portables.", "source_categories": ["tech"]}

We know it has a fantastic range of features for mobile videographers and vloggers -- arguably the new 256GB storage option is aimed at these users. But how about these newly introduced camera features? Are they worth having? Is the AI cam better than my own judgement? And what about Bright Mode? Can algorithms save blurry night shots? We went out on an (inadvertently) wet and chilly Barcelona walking tour one evening to test these new camera tricks. Are they' enough to dethrone the likes of the Pixel 2, or at least reassess the V30 series when it comes to low-light photography? Let's start with the AI cam -- I'd argue it's more machine learning than AI, but I digress. It includes eight presets that run through the usual camera settings you'll find since the dawn of the digital point-and-shoot: Portrait, pet, city/building, flower, sunrise, sunset, food and landscape. In short, it broadly encompasses most things people take images of with their phones. (I would have loved a high shutter-speed activity mode, or something for taking images of moving objects, but I can't have everything.) There's a simple toggle inside the main camera app, and once activated, the phone tries to suss out what it's looking at. During this, descriptive words appear and disappear on screen, as a neat little signpost of what the AI thinks it's looking at. Once it's come to its conclusion, a handy vibration lets you know that it's calibrated for what the V30S has decided is in front of it. You'll also see the presets in action, giving a live view of \"food\" mode before you press the shutter. The correct shooting mode kicked in just about every time. Mistakes happened, but over a good day of shooting with the V30S ThinQ, I didn't encounter many. During a low-light centered evening, the phone understandably took a little longer to figure out what it was looking at. What does this \"AI\" Cam do then? It depends. Just like those presets from cameras of yesteryear, it might crank up the contrast or rein in brightness on city shoots, or boost colors for sunsets, portraits and food blogging. Judging from the images, there are no AI smarts here with regards to how it massages your pictures: the smarts are all baked into image, or scene, recognition. I really like the AI cam. It's simple and eminently user-friendly. You don't think about it and it leaves more time for doing things and less time fussing over camera settings and filters. During a night out where red wine may have been imbibed, I could grab more shots of co-workers, friends (and their food) without excess tinkering or labored posing. That said, I wasn't always happy with the results. Food shots often suffered from fuzzy edging -- excess fake bokeh was the culprit. The colors were sometimes excessively ramped up, too. Usually, that's what I do with my own food pics though. So how about Bright Mode? LG's attempt to improve low-light shooting is an algorithm-based one, aimed at improving photos the V30S would otherwise struggle with. According to the company, it squeezes image resolution lower, which allows for brighter, if less detailed, results. With this test model V30S ThinQ, I didn't glean any remarkable changes in results, toggling the mode on and off. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried it out a second night, and still saw barely any differences. Pixel binning is definitely at work, with both images shrinking to roughly four megapixels each. I wish I could see how images looked before and after, regardless of the resolution crunch. Which shot would have been better? I'll never know. We've reached out to LG after issues during our video shoot-out, to double check we were using the settings correctly. Bright mode doesn't kick in for 4K and 60 fps video, nor when using the wonderful wide-angle lens on the V30S, but we weren't using that when we took our low-light shots here. My suspicion is that the phone is always using the Bright Mode, even if the icon display (and menu toggle) says it isn't. I would prefer a Bright Mode that wasn't switched on by the whims of the phone's own software. Let me decide, okay? I tested the V30S alongside the wonderful Pixel 2, which takes stupidly good photos most of the time. The bigger camera sensors on LG's new phone pulled in more detail but I preferred the results on the Pixel phone overall. It seemed to have a more pleasant distribution of light and contrast on these photos of Barcelona Cathedral. The Pixel 2, however, is a younger phone than the original V30 (the hardware, remember, is largely the same in the V30S), so it might not be all that shocking that it's still the handier smartphone camera. The V30S's camera software upgrades add to the experience, but mostly help round out the phone's weaknesses in still photography. Let's see what LG does next: We shouldn't have too wait too long.

The International Football Association Board, which sets rules for FIFA as well as UK associations, has unanimously approved the use of VARs in soccer (aka football) matches on a permanent basis.  So long as they go through a \"mandatory approval process,\" they can implement the play review technology if they like.  The decision comes after an independent university study showed that VARs had a net positive effect. As elsewhere, the aim is to produce more accurate play calls when there are serious disputes, such as for goals, penalties, red cards (but not a second yellow card) and cases of punishing the wrong person.  This theoretically prevents game-changing mistakes while keeping the downtime to a minimum, and real-world tests have shown that the technology can work.  In the US' Major League Soccer, for instance, it decided the outcome for matches soon after its introduction. Not everyone sees VARs this way, of course.  Some have argued that it still slows down the game too much, and that the process of using it is too opaque for fans.  And of course, it's limited by the nature of the hardware.  In at least one match (between Portugese teams Aves and Boavista), the referee had to let a questionable goal stand after a fan inadvertently blocked a camera with a flag during the crucial moment. As it stands, whether or not your favorite league or tournament uses VARs is up in the air -- they're not obligated to implement it.  FIFA World Cup organizers are expected to decide on using VARs on March 16th and are likely to adopt them, but it's not so clear elswhere. The UK's Premier League and Europe's Champions League aren't adopting the technology for their next seasons, but France's Ligue 1 is; Germany's Bundesliga makes its choice on March 22nd.  It's doubtful they'll reject the technology outright, however.

While they're still figuring out how things will work in their joint venture, they have a clear goal in mind: to develop a \"fully-integrated, production-quality software for automated driving.\" The partners will invest 300 billion yen or around $2.8 billion to achieve that goal and are already in the process of looking for the perfect location for their headquarters in Tokyo. Once that's done, they plan to staff up the HQ with 1,000 employees, both newly hired and taken from their own personnel.

They've always been gorgeous and capable machines, with near bezel-less screens that other computer makers quickly copied. Most importantly, they brought an air of refinement to the Windows laptop market -- something you could previously only find from Apple. Dell's latest XPS 13 continues that tradition of excellence, though there are some changes that might irk longtime fans of the lineup. Dell\u2019s latest XPS 13 doesn\u2019t stray from the line\u2019s high standards. It\u2019s fast, slim and sturdy. Sure, the company didn\u2019t change much, but it didn\u2019t really have to. As you'd expect, the XPS 13 still feels like a high-end machine, thanks to its sleek aluminum case and rock-solid build quality. This time around, Dell added a white interior to its rose-gold case to make it more fashionable. It might just be a taste issue, but many Engadget editors found the new styling to be a bit too cheap and garish for the XPS line. The woven-glass-fiber palm rest feels comfortable, at least, and Dell claims it's also stain-resistant. Unfortunately, its kryptonite is sunscreen and mustard, so definitely don't bring it to a beach cookout. But, rest assured, you can still snag the XPS 13 with a silver case and black-carbon-fiber interior if you'd prefer to stick with the traditional style. This year's XPS 13 comes in a slimmer and lighter package, weighing in at 2.7 pounds and measuring between 7.8 mm and 11.6 mm thick. In comparison, the previous XPS 13 was a bit heavier if you wanted a touchscreen, at 2.9 pounds. It's light, but because the case looks so thin, it feels denser than you'd expect. To make the newer case work, Dell had to drop USB-A ports and a full-size SD card slot. Instead, you've got three USB-C ports, two of which are compatible with Intel's Thunderbolt 3 standard, as well as a micro-SD card slot. And yes, you can charge from any of the USB-C connections. Gamers will also appreciate the ability to hook up an external GPU to the Thunderbolt ports, something that wasn't possible in previous models. And of course, there's a gorgeous 13.3-inch screen available in 1080p or 4K at the high end. You can choose between standard and touchscreen options, and there's HDR support, finally. That'll let you see video that's both brighter and darker than before. The \"InfinityEdge\" bezels are 23 percent thinner than before, according to Dell, though it's not something I noticed at first. (Probably because they were already pretty slim to begin with.) Another minor change: Dell moved the 720p webcam to the center instead of being off to the side. It's still stuck at the bottom of the screen -- which is a casualty of that InfinityEdge display -- but at least it's easier to align your face properly. There are also four far-field microphones in the XPS 13, which will make it easier for you to shout commands at Cortana, or clearly chat with friends over Skype. E2,927 / P1,651 / X438 There aren't really any surprises with the XPS 13: It's simply a solid and refined ultraportable. It's plenty fast, thanks to Intel's eighth-generation processors. It didn't have any trouble keeping up with my daily workflow, which involves juggling dozens of browser tabs, Slack, Spotify, Evernote and a variety of other apps. Still, I was testing a model with an i7 CPU capable of reaching 4GHz with 8GB of RAM -- the entry-level XPS 13s only have 4GB of memory and slower i5 chips. I didn't have a chance to hook up an external GPU to the XPS 13, but honestly, I never had much of a need to. I've never expected ultraportables like this to be capable gaming rigs. So far, Dell has only included integrated graphics in its 13-inch premium laptops. And while that's gotten more capable over the years, it's still never going to let you play high-end games. The larger XPS 15 offers dedicated graphics, but you'll have to give up a bit of portability if you go that route. Of course, lugging around an external GPU box kinda cuts into the portability of the machine as well. But it still offers you a way to game seriously when you're at home or at a LAN party. The 4K screen we tested was also impressive: It was bright, sharp and made everything pop. It even fared well in direct sunlight while I was wearing polarized sunglasses (something competitors like the Surface Laptop have trouble with). HDR is a welcome addition. While it's far more essential in your home theater, it's still to be able to enjoy Netflix to its fullest on the go. Thankfully, Dell didn't change the XPS 13's input options much. The keyboard is still a joy to type on, thanks to its generous 1.3mm travel distance and overall responsiveness. It's one of those keyboards where it feels like words just flow out of my fingers. The Precision touchpad is also as smooth and accurate, as we've come to expect. In our battery test, it lasted 9 hours and 50 minutes, which is better than the XPS 2-in-1 and the Zenbook 3, but less than what we've seen from the Surface Laptop and other premium notebooks. The somewhat average performance can be chalked up to the 4K display, which takes more power to drive. The 1080p versions of the XPS 13 should get a few more hours worth of juice. The XPS 13 starts at $999 with an 8th gen Core i5 CPU, 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. That's decent, but we'd recommend bumping up to the $1,200 model at least, which has 8GB of RAM and a faster 256GB SSD. It'll perform much better, and last longer without needing an upgrade, as well. Frankly, it's about time PC makers started making 8GB of RAM standard. You might have been able to survive with 4GB a few years ago, but these days, Chrome alone could gobble that up quickly. As for alternatives, Apple's 13-inch MacBook Pro starts at $1,300 with a seventh-gen chip, while the Surface Laptop starts at $800 (albeit with an underpowered processor). Just as we've seen for the past few years, the XPS 13 is a strong competitor both in terms of price and performance with other premium ultraportables. Overall, the XPS 13 remains one of the best ultrabooks on the market. It's fast, sturdy and sports a gorgeous screen. Dell didn't make any big changes to the design, but then again, it didn't really have to. When you've got something as good as the XPS 13 lineup, it's better to stick with what works.", "source_categories": ["tech"]}

But it seems Sanders may have gotten ahead of herself -- the Entertainment Software Association (ESA), which represents the US video game industry, released a statement last night saying that neither it nor non of its members received an invitation to talk with the president. Here's the full statement: ESA and our member companies have not received an invitation to meet with President Trump. The same video games played in the US are played worldwide; however, the level of gun violence is exponentially higher in the US than in other countries. Numerous authorities have examined the scientific record and found there is no link between media content and real-life violence. The US video game industry has a long history of partnering with parents and more than 20 years of rating video games through the Entertainment Software Rating Board. We take great steps to provide tools to help players and parents make informed entertainment decisions. Members of the ESA include Nintendo, Sony's PlayStation division, Microsoft, EA, Activision, Take Two and a number of other companies. In a briefing this morning, Sanders said that invites went out on Thursday, so it's possible that they just haven't reached the right people yet. We've asked the ESA to update us if and when it or the companies the group represents receive invitations to the White House.", "source_categories": ["tech"]}

In a blog post , Elevation Lab founder Casey Hopkins wrote that a Chinese manufacturer ripped off its popular under-desk headphone stand, \"The Anchor\" and is selling it cheap on Amazon and taking all its sales. Worse, he claims that Amazon is effectively abetting such counterfeiters and could do away with it via a simple change. According to Hopkins, the counterfeit seller \"literally reverse engineered it, made steel compression molds, made the logo wrong, used fake 3M adhesive that's very thin and was die-cut smaller than the top, they used a lower durometer silicone so it flexes more, it has huge mold parting lines, and the packaging is literally photocopied then reprinted (you can tell by the lack of image contrast).\" The result, he says, is that \"customers are unknowingly buying crap versions of the product, while both Amazon and the scammers are profiting, and the reputation you've built goes down the toilet.\" It's particularly onerous for small businesses, because new sellers pop up constantly and it can take Amazon precious days to remove them. Customers are unknowingly buying crap versions of the product, while both Amazon and the scammers are profiting, and the reputation you've built goes down the toilet. And yet the fix is simple, Hopkins says. To stop counterfeiting, Amazon established a registry of approved sellers in 2016, aka the \"Brand Registry.\" All it has to do to help small inventors is add a check box for suppliers that only sell directly to Amazon and don't use wholesalers. \"Anyone else would have have to get approval or high vetting to sell the product,\" Hopkins said. On top of that, Amazon needs to increase its Brand Registry team so it can swat away counterfeit scammers more quickly, he believes. Amazon has been regularly criticized for being too lax on counterfeiters, a problem that has kept the fashion world well away from the site, for instance. Chanel recently won a judgement against counterfeiters, but only after it persisted following a court setback. Smaller companies, though, are ill-equipped to take on expensive lawsuits. The feds might soon wade into the fray, however. The US Government Accountability Office recently completed an investigation and was able to purchase 47 counterfeit products from Amazon, Walmart and other companies. Senator Orrin Hatch plans to convene a Senate hearing on the issue. Update : Amazon has replied to Engadget, and though it didn't address the specific complaints from Elevation Lab, said \"we work closely with vendors, sellers and rights owners to strengthen protections for their brands on Amazon.\" Its full statement is below. Our customers trust that when they make a purchase through Amazon's website\u2014either directly from Amazon or from one of its millions of third-party sellers\u2014they will receive authentic products manufactured by the true manufacturer of those products. We strictly prohibit the sale of counterfeit products and invest heavily \u2013 both funds and company energy \u2013 to ensure our policy against the sale of such products is followed. We work closely with vendors, sellers and rights owners to strengthen protections for their brands on Amazon. Any rights owner can register with Amazon's Brand Registry service to manage and protect their brand and intellectual property rights on Amazon. In addition, we encourage rights owners who have a product authenticity concern to notify us, and we investigate any such claims thoroughly. We remove suspected counterfeit items as soon as we become aware of them, and we remove bad actors from selling on Amazon. We have successfully taken legal action against a number of bad actors and will continue to pursue legal action and work with law enforcement. In order to detect bad actors and potentially counterfeit products, we employ dedicated teams of software engineers, research scientists, program managers, and investigators to operate and continually refine our anti-counterfeiting program. When a business registers to sell products through Amazon's Marketplace, Amazon's systems scan information for signals that the business might be a bad actor, and Amazon blocks most of those bad actors during registration before they can offer any products for sale. Amazon makes significant investments in innovative machine learning and automated systems in order to anticipate and stay ahead of bad actors. On an ongoing basis, Amazon's systems also automatically and continuously scan numerous data points related to sellers, products, brands, and offers to detect activity that indicates products offered might be counterfeit. Customers are always protected by our A-to-Z guarantee, whether they make a purchase from Amazon or a third-party seller. If ever the product doesn't arrive or isn't as advertised, customers can contact our customer support for a full refund of their order. We take this fight against bad actors very seriously and will not rest.", "source_categories": ["tech"]}
{"title": "'Far Cry 5' is deeper than you think", "post_ts": 1519948800, "tags": ["art", "av", "DanHay", "FarCry", "FarCry5", "gaming", "hands-on", "Ubisoft"], "source_url": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/02/far-cry-5-hands-on/", "content": "Far Cry 5 is the most socially relevant game in the series yet. This is the first time Ubisoft has brought the open world franchise to America -- specifically, to the wilderness of Montana. But it's more than just another free for all shooter. The game is really a statement on the increasing influence of violent religious extremism in the US, and the need for good people to take a stand against them. While we got a brief glimpse at the game's partner mechanics at E3 , we recently a had chance to play it for a few hours, and came away mostly impressed. It puts you in the shoes of a rookie cop, who's sent to arrest Joseph Seed, the head of a dangerous cult called The Project at Eden's Gate. They're heavily armed, fanatical about their devotion to their leader, also known as The Father, and are quickly taking over more territory. As you'd expect, your plans to arrest Seed quickly go off the rails. You end up becoming part of a resistance movement, whose goal is to take down the cult by going after Joseph Seed and the rest of his family. \"The thing that's truly the genesis for [ Far Cry 5 ] is just this feeling like we're on the edge of something,\" said Dan Hay, creative director for Far Cry 5 , in an interview with Engadget. \"There are moments in history where you can kind of look back and say, 'Hey this is the moment where everything is changing.' It feels like three years ago, we were heading into one of those. The game is about that. If you're on the edge of something and it was that one time it was all going to go to shit, would you know it?\" Like every Far Cry game, you've got a huge world to explore, and you're free to go about your objectives however you like. This time, though, there's a \"Resistance Meter,\" which tracks your progress throughout the game's several regions. You can build up the influence of the resistance by saving captured citizens, destroying Eden's Gate structures, completing missions and liberating outposts from cultists. You can also team up with allies throughout the game, each of which bring different skills to every fight. There's even a dog named Boomer that can retrieve animals you hunt and attack enemies for you. (And yes, you can pet him on-demand.) As is typical for a Far Cry title, the game looks gorgeous, with vast environments that capture Montana's natural beauty. Thankfully, the developers at Ubisoft also made the gameplay more organic. Instead of climbing towers to find things to do, you actually have to seek out and talk to people. You can read into that what you will. Like the entire game, it seems like a metaphor for something all of America needs to do to move forward as a society. During my playtime with the game, I got to explore the outdoor environment, and take down some stray enemies. With the help of an ally, I also cleared a huge cultist base. Doing so took several tries, but the beauty of Far Cry is that you've got multiple ways to solve every problem. For me, going stealthy with a bow and arrow was best. Ubisoft also worked with Mia Donovan, an expert on cults and fringe groups, who helped add a layer of authenticity to Eden's Gate. The game explores why seemingly normal people would be seduced by dangerous organizations, and at points you'll get a first-hand look at how that process works. \"I think games have come to a point now where it's okay to explore certain topics,\" Hay said. \"We also understand that at first blush, people are going to look at the game and say you're making a game about this .... And we say hold on, this [other topic] is what we're actually doing. We take a global perspective about things.\" While Far Cry 5 is ultimately just a piece of pop culture entertainment, I'm fascinated by how much Ubisoft Montreal is leaning into such a socially relevant story. Of course, you could just play it like any other game in the series, but it's hard to ignore the subtext. It's a game about the resistance, fighting to save America.", "source_categories": ["tech"]}
